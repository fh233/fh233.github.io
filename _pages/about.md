# Greetings!
This is Feng. I am currently a graduate student at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey. My research interest includes dynamics, control and machine learning and its application in robotics. I am conbining the maching learning-based tools for robotics motion planning and control. I have been working on autonomous bicycle, mobile manipulation, agile maneuvering control and other underactuated balancing robots.

# üìù Projects 

<b> 1. Lenaring-based control for underactuatd balcne robots </b><br /> 
For the uncertainites and modelling errors, a Gaussian Process based maching learning framewrok has been proposed to deal with modelling and contorl. The learning based method is integreated with EIC-based control for underactuated balance robots. Somultaneously we can achieve trajectorying tracking and balacne control.

<b> 2. Ski-stunt Maneuvering Control of Racing Truck </b><br />

A ski-stunt maneuver is a type of aggressive vehicle motions in which a four-wheel vehicle runs on two wheels on one side.  We present the safety-guaranteed motion control of  autonomous ski-stunt maneuvers. (see the video abvoe)



<b> 3. Cordinated Control of Mobile Robot </b><br /> 
- autonomous bicycle robot control for crossing obstacles with impulsive actuation

As a single-track mobile platform, bikebot (i.e., bicycle-based robot) has attractive capability to navigate through narrow, off-road terrain. However, running crossing step-like obstacles creates challenges. This project presents a novel autonomous bikebot control with two assistive legs to navigate crossing obstacles. (see the video abvoe)

- coordinate control of a manipulator on a bicycle robot control 

We present a coordinated pose control of mobile manipulation with the stationary bikebot. A coordinated planning and control design is presented to determine the balance-prioritized posture control under kinematic and dynamic constraints. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHQRNrrnPMc&ab_channel=FengHan"> Video</a>


<b> 4. Learning-Based Motion Pattern Recogniztion and Control </b><br /> 

Using a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) cells. to idenfity the human/animal gait and predict the poses in the real time with only IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) measurement avaiable.
